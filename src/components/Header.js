        Hi my name is Zach and I am a software engineer! As a former musician
        and psychology student, I bring a unique blend of creativity and
        analytical thinking to my work as a software engineer. With a strong
        background in the arts and a deep understanding of human behavior, I am
        able to approach problem-solving from multiple angles and create
        intuitive and user-friendly solutions. Whether I'm developing new
        applications or optimizing existing ones, I am driven by a passion for
        creating functional and aesthetically pleasing software. I am excited to
        bring my diverse skill set and fresh perspective to any team, and I am
        always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a
        developer.
