          Hi, my name is Zach and I am a software engineer
        </span>{" "}
        As a former musician and psychology student, I bring a unique blend of
        creativity and analytical thinking to my work as a software engineer.
        With a strong background in the arts and a deep understanding of human
        behavior, I am able to approach problem-solving from multiple angles and
        create intuitive and user-friendly solutions. Whether I'm developing new
        applications or optimizing existing ones, I am driven by a passion for
        creating functional and aesthetically pleasing software. I am excited to
        bring my diverse skill set and fresh perspective to any team, and I am
        always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a
        developer.
