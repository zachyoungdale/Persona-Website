        Hi my name is Zach! As a former musician and psychology student, I bring
        a unique blend of creativity and analytical thinking to my work as a
        software engineer. With a strong background in the arts and a deep
        understanding of human behavior, I am able to approach problem-solving
        from multiple angles and create intuitive and user-friendly solutions.
        Whether I'm developing new applications or optimizing existing ones, I
        am driven by a passion for creating functional and aesthetically
        pleasing software. I am excited to bring my diverse skill set and fresh
        perspective to any team, and I am always looking for new challenges and
        opportunities to grow as a developer.
